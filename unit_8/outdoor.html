							<h2> Favorite playgrounds </h2>
								<p> We mostly spend time at the playgrounds in Central Park above the 80s.
								Most playgrounds have water in summer where the kids (and caregivers) can cool off but most are directly in the sun. There are some playrounds that provide sun and shade if you and your charge want to avoid being in the sun but still like to go outside and enjoy the nice weather.

							<h2> Bronx Zoo <h2>
								<h3> Free admission on wednesdays </h3>
									<p> If you have <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/idnyc/index.page"> IDNYC card </a> you should go to the Bronx Zoo and sign up for a free membership for one year. That way you'll have free access to Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo and also the membership offers many other perks. However, the Bronx Zoo is free on wednesdays. Make sure you get there by the time it opens at 10 am because it gets crowded!
